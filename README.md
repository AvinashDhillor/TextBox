Text Box - An online text editing web app

A real-time tool which helps user to fasten his daily routine!

Let’s see how..

When you write any formal message or email which has the same content but you have to change client name, salutation, references (for a particular receiver).
In a closer approach suppose you have typed an email of 60 lines and your client name is somewhere at line 32.
You would first search from the beginning and edit or make a note for every client.
And if you have to change 10 different words in 300 lines!!
It turns out to be a time elapser.

How can this be solved?

This platform gives you a ease to declare or note as variable text when you start typing the text!
All these type of text fields which you want to edit for future use will be returned to editor’s dashboard and save them!

Now no need to search for stuffs, they’ll be waiting for you in the dashboard itself! :)
